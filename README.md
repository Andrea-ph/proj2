This project implements an extended **SEIR epidemic model** that incorporates **household** and **network-based** contact structures.  
The aim is to explore how realistic social structures influence epidemic spread compared to purely random mixing.

---

## 📘 Model Overview

- **S → E**: Infection via  
  1️⃣ Household contacts (`αh`)  
  2️⃣ Regular contact network (`αc`)  
  3️⃣ Random background mixing (`αr`)  
- **E → I**: Transition from exposed to infectious (`γ`)  
- **I → R**: Recovery (`δ`)  

Each person has:
- A *household ID* (randomly assigned, up to `hmax = 5`)  
- A *set of network contacts* generated by `get.net()`  
- A *sociability parameter* β that controls infectivity

## 🧮 Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `get.net()` | Generates a social contact network excluding same-household members |
| `nseir()` | Runs the SEIR simulation for `nt` days |
| `plot_nseir()` | Plots daily S, E, I, R trajectories and identifies peaks |
| `run_four_scenarios()` | Compares four epidemic scenarios with/without structure and heterogeneity |

## 🚀 How to Run

```r
set.seed(42)
source("structured_seir.R")
res <- run_four_scenarios()
